## Conclusions
- Conclused that cnt value has strong linear relationsship with provided Independent variables listed below:
  temp, atemp, year, humidity, WindSpeed, Winter season, weathersit_snow
- Concluded that most of the variables have multicollinearity with other variables and as many as 15 features/Dummy variables were dropped during variaous steps of Linear Regression modeling.
